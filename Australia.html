        After being discharged Helmut changed his surname to Newton, and with that new name eventually became known internationally as the premier fashion and portrait photographer, notorious for his provocative nudes. The historian of Australian photography,
         Gael Newton (no relative), claims that Newton has ‘left nothing to represent his early work in Melbourne in the 1950s’, whilst a European associate, Karl Lagerfeld, writes of the ‘unknown, mysterious Australian period’.2 The publication of Newton's Autobiography
          (New York, Doubleday, 2003) has added considerably to our knowledge of his activities in 1950s Melbourne, but most of his photographs are unknown or forgotten, except for a few (mostly portraits) he has chosen to reproduce in his autobiography or other collections he has published.

     <p>Newton was interned by British authorities while in Singapore and was sent to Australia on board the Queen Mary, arriving in Sydney on 27 September 1940.[5] 
         Internees travelled to the camp at Tatura, Victoria by train under armed guard. He was released from internment in 1942 and briefly worked as a fruit picker in Northern Victoria. In August 1942, 
         he enlisted with the Australian Army and worked as a truck driver. After the war in 1945, he became a British subject and changed his name to Newton in 1946.

        In 1948, he married actress June Browne, who performed under the stage name June Brunell. She later became a successful photographer under the ironic pseudonym Alice Springs (after Alice Springs, the central Australian town).
