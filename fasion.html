        “Prolific” and “widely imitated” claimed <i>The New York Times,</i> German-Australian fashion photographer Helmut Newton was a <i>Vogue</i> favourite and an iconoclast within the world of high fashion. Now,
         the Helmut Newton Foundation invites visitors to see not only his many prolific images but also experience more “surprises” that lay in store.
         
    </p> 
    <p><b>Newton</b> established his style during the swinging 60s in Paris. The fashion of the time, such as that of André Courrèges – one of the inventors
        of the mini-skirt and go-go boot – is documented in the images of Newton. He looked to bend the conventions of photography within the world of fashion which he found sometimes stifling.
         As one of the most often published photographers, the foundation hopes that, following intensive research in the foundation’s archives,
          “forgotten” photographs of historic celebrity and couture culture that are coming to light in the exhibition will continue Newton’s legacy of surprising, shocking, and enchanting viewers.

    Chronologically tracing the life of the Berlin-born photographer, Matthias Harder, the foundation’s curator, wants to display around 300 works depicting the likes of Karl Lagerfeld, Cindy Crawford and Carla Bruni,
     as well as shoots for Prada, Thierry Mugler, and Calvin Klein, with half of these images being shown for the first time. As well as lesser-known aspects of Newton’s work, such as his unconventional fashion photographs
      which span decades and reflect the zeitgeist of each cultural era. Polaroids and contact sheets complement works in the exhibit, aiming to give insight into Newton’s creative process as well as special publications, archival material, and quotes from the photographer
